## User Story

* I've created an houry calendar app for scheduling your workday.
* Each hour from 9am to 5pm has an associated textbox where you can input your schedule for that time.
* Once you're done typing, you can save your schedule info by clicking on the button with a lock on it to the right of the text area.
* The schedule info is then saved in local storage and will remain in this textbox even if you refresh your browser.
* The textboxes are color-coded to differentiate scheduled events in the past, present, or future.  Events in the past are color-coded in grey, events in the present are color-coded in pink, and events in the future are color-coded in green.
* Below the hourly schedule is a button to clear the entire schedule.  If you press this button an alert pops up asking you to confirm that you want to delete the whole schedule and if so, it is deleted.
